Serial
 - Explanation: good
 - Implementation: used vector of vector of cells, particles are processed in original order, so losing temporal locality by not processing all particles in same bin
 - Results: OK

OpenMP
 - Explanation: Not much explanation for what's parallelized and why.  Some explanation for problem with binning particles without synchronization.
 - Implementation: Used 2D array of locks (initialized on stack, but ok)
 - Results: Good strong scaling results for 10,000
